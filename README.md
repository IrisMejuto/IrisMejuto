Passionate about technology and business, I am enjoying a career transition into Data Analytics <img decoding="async" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">

🔍 I'm a curious person with lots of energy ⚡ and a strong passion for continuous learning, especially in business and technology 📊. 
During my studies in marketing 📈, I realized how much I enjoy analyzing problems. This interest led me to take courses aimed at understanding and resolving complex issues. It was after this period that I discovered data analysis 📊, which quickly became my new fascination. Ever since, I've been dedicated to learning the necessary technical skills for data analysis.

My diverse work experience across various sectors has equipped me with a broad understanding, allowing me to see the bigger picture of how businesses operate and the systems that support them 🌐. I'm really looking forward to the chance to use my knowledge in a data analyst role, where I can continue to learn and develop my skills in this exciting field 💼.
